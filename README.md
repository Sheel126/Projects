# Finance Vibe 📈

## Project Intent & Engineering Philosophy

The **Finance Vibe** project is engineered as a **Modular Data Pipeline**.  
The intent is to transition from isolated "scripts" to a **Systematic Analysis Engine**.

By decoupling **data ingestion**, **mathematical processing**, and **reporting layers**, we ensure the system is:

- Idempotent
- Scalable
- Reproducible

This project prioritizes:

- **Environmental Parity**
- **Mathematical Robustness**

The system operates within a stable **5-year weekly regime** to eliminate high-frequency noise and ensure reproducible results across any compute node.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Hermetic Environment (Dev Containers)

We utilize **Docker-based Dev Containers** to enforce _Environment-as-Code_.

This approach:

- Locks the Python 3.12 interpreter
- Locks system dependencies
- Stores environment configuration in version control

The environment becomes a **disposable, reproducible artifact**.

---

### Stateless Logic & State Isolation

The repository architecture enforces a strict boundary between:

- `/src/` — Application logic
- `/data/` — System state

Within `/data/`:

- `/raw/` — Immutable source data
- `/logs/` — Analytical output

This isolation ensures:

- The pipeline can be audited independently
- Data can be wiped without risking the codebase
- Code and state remain cleanly separated

---

### Shadow Math (Architectural Redundancy)

The system implements a **Dual-Engine Pattern** for logic verification.

A **Shadow Engine** (`analysis_engine_local.py`) runs alongside the primary engine to enable:

- Differential testing
- Safe mathematical experimentation
- Validation of scoring changes

This is particularly important for validating our **Manual Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** implementation before promoting changes to the main pipeline.

---

### Decoupled Orchestration

`run_vibe.py` functions as a **Stateless Orchestrator**.

It manages the lifecycle:

```
Discovery → Ingestion → Analysis → Comparison
```

This design allows:

- Execution via external schedulers (Cron / GitHub Actions)
- Clear exit codes for failure handling
- Clean separation between orchestration and computation

## Strategic Trend & Momentum Pipeline

A professional-grade Python framework for fetching and analyzing stock data from Yahoo Finance.

This project uses a **Composite Vibe Score** to identify high-conviction trends using weekly data science workflows.

# 🏗 Project Structure

```
src/finance_vibe/
```

### Core Python Logic

- **config.py** — Central settings (5y weekly data, ETFs, paths)
- **ticker_provider.py** — Refreshes active stocks & benchmark ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM)
- **data_ingestor.py** — Pulls 5-year weekly historical data
- **analysis_engine.py** — Primary math engine (SMA, MACD, RSI, Robust CCI)
- **analysis_engine_local.py** — Shadow engine for validation
- **swing_scanner.py** — Filters valid swing trade setups using EMA, RSI, ATR, and MACD
- **trade_planner.py** — Generates detailed trade plans including stock entries, stops, targets, and LEAPS options recommendations
- **run_vibe.py** — Master orchestrator to execute the full pipeline

# 🚀 How to Use

## Run in Github CodeSpaces

- Easiest way to run and try it out is github codespaces
- See documents attached in repo
- https://github.com/jigar3730/finance-vibe/blob/main/How%20to%20run%20in%20Github%20codespaces.docx

## 1️⃣ Open in Dev Container

Ensure Docker is running.

Reopen the project in the container to auto-install:

- Python 3.12
- Pandas
- Required extensions (Rainbow CSV, Excel Viewer)

---

## 2️⃣ Run the Pipeline

Execute the master command to ingest data and run analysis:

```bash
python src/finance_vibe/run_vibe.py
```

To clear out old raw files and force a fresh fetch:

```bash
rm data/raw/*.csv

# 📈 Technical Logic: The Composite Vibe Score

The core **Actionable Logic** is driven by a **Weighted Scoring System (-10 to +10)** to identify trend strength and momentum confluence.

---

## 📊 Scoring Matrix

| Indicator      | Logic                                | Weight      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Trend**      | Price > SMA(20) > SMA(50)            | ±4.0 Points |
| **Momentum**   | MACD Histogram & RSI > their 20-EMAs | ±3.0 Points |
| **Volatility** | Robust CCI > 0 and > its 20-EMA      | ±3.0 Points |

---

## 🎯 Action Tiers

- 🔥 **GO ALL IN** (Score 8 to 10) — Maximum bullish confluence
- ✅ **ACCUMULATE** (Score 4 to 7) — Positive trend and momentum
- ⏳ **WAIT / CASH** (Score -3 to 3) — Neutral zone; no clear edge
- ⚠️ **DISTRIBUTE** (Score -4 to -7) — Bearish divergence or weakening trend
- 🚫 **AVOID** (Score -8 to -10) — High-conviction bearish trend

---

# 🛠 Project Standards

## Robust CCI Calculation

Uses a manual **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)** formula to prevent extreme values (-4000+) during low-volatility periods.

## Data Transparency

Reports include the raw indicator values (SMA20, CCI, RSI, etc.) alongside the final score for manual verification.

## Archive Logic

Every run generates a timestamped CSV in:

```
data/logs/
```

for historical tracking.

# 📝 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Automation** — Set cron to execute `run_vibe.py` every Saturday at 09:00
- [ ] **Alerting** — Integrate Discord/Telegram Webhooks for high-score signals
- [ ] **Visualization** — Add Matplotlib logic to generate "Vibe Charts" (Price vs. Score)
